# Project Name

Vatti-Pet-Hotel

## Description

Duration: 7 hours

This application simulates a basic intake for a Pet Resort customer. Users can input their name, pet's name, breed, and color. Once the pet is added, their information will be displayed and stored on the DOM and in a databse. You can toggle the check-in or out status of the pet by clicking the 'Check In' button and the date of check-in will be displayed. If the 'Check Out' button is pressed, it will display the check-out date. After the pet has left the hotel one can delete the pet's information from the table, as well as the database using the delete button.
